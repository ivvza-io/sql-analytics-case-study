# Semantic Layer (Views)

This document describes the core semantic views exposed by the PostgreSQL model.  
These views provide analytics-ready datasets with consistent definitions and a clearly defined **grain**, enabling reproducible analysis (EDA, SPC, and traceability) with minimal downstream wrangling.

---

## Design Principles

- **Analytics-first:** views are shaped for common analytical questions, not for data entry.
- **Stable grain:** each view explicitly documents what “one row” represents to avoid accidental duplication.
- **Consistent keys:** `heat_num` is the primary join key across views.
- **Composable:** views are designed to be joined together to build subject-specific analytical datasets (chemistry, lab results, product characterization).

### 1) Heats by Alloy

**Purpose**  
Provide the alloy associated with each heat for filtering, grouping, and segmentation.

**Grain**  
- 1 row per heat

**Primary key / join key**  
- `heat_num`

**Core columns (typical)**  
- `heat_num`  
- `alloy_code`

**Inputs (sources)**  
- heats / casting entities  
- alloy reference tables

**Typical questions it answers**
- How many heats were produced per alloy over time?
- Which heats belong to a given alloy for downstream analysis (chemistry, lab, SPC)?

**Example query**
```sql
select
  alloy_code,
  count(*) as heats_count
from v_heats_by_alloy
group by alloy_code
order by heats_count desc;
```

### 2) Chemistry Results by Heat

**Purpose**  
Expose chemistry results at the heat level by joining chemistry sessions and measured element values into a single analytics-ready view, while preserving the analytical meaning of each session type.

**Grain**  
- 1 row per (`heat_num`, `chem_session_id`, `element_symbol`)  
  Each heat can have multiple chemistry sessions, and each session contains multiple element measurements.

**Primary key / join keys**  
- `heat_num`  
- `chem_session_id`  
- `element_symbol`

**Core columns (typical)**  
- `heat_num`  
- `chem_session_id`  
- `session_type`  
  - `preanalysis` — analysis performed prior to casting, used for alloy adjustments (may occur multiple times per heat, e.g. pre 1, pre 2)  
  - `drop_analysis` — analysis associated with the casting drop, representing final heat chemistry  
- `session_seq` (optional)  
- `element_symbol` (e.g., Si, Fe, Cu, Mn, Mg)  
- `element_value` (numeric)

**Inputs (sources)**  
- chemistry sessions table  
- chemistry element values table  
- foreign key resolution to `heat_num`

**Typical questions it answers**
- What is the final (drop) chemistry for each heat?
- How did chemistry evolve from preanalysis to drop analysis?
- Which heats are out of specification based on drop analysis?
- How does chemistry behave over time (SPC) for a given alloy?

**Example queries**
```sql
-- Final chemistry (drop analysis)
select
  heat_num,
  element_symbol,
  element_value
from v_chem_by_heats
where heat_num = 123456
  and session_type = 'drop_analysis'
order by element_symbol;

-- Chemistry evolution (preanalysis → drop)
select
  heat_num,
  session_type,
  session_seq,
  element_symbol,
  element_value
from v_chem_by_heats
where heat_num = 123456
order by session_type, session_seq, element_symbol;

-- SPC-ready dataset (drop analysis only)
select
  vha.alloy_code,
  vch.heat_num,
  vch.element_symbol,
  vch.element_value
from v_chem_by_heats vch
join v_heats_by_alloy vha
  on vha.heat_num = vch.heat_num
where vha.alloy_code = '7072'
  and vch.element_symbol = 'Fe'
  and vch.session_type = 'drop_analysis'
order by vch.heat_num;
```

### 3) Lab Values by Heat

**Purpose**  
Expose laboratory results at the heat level by joining lab test sessions and measured values into a single analytics-ready view.  
This view supports mechanical property monitoring, SPC, and customer/product segmentation.

**Grain**  
- 1 row per (`heat_num`, `lab_session_id`, `lab_test`)  
  Each heat typically has one lab session, with an optional reanalysis session.

**Primary key / join keys**  
- `heat_num`  
- `lab_session_id`  
- `lab_test`

**Core columns (typical)**  
- `heat_num`  
- `lab_session_id`  
- `session_type` (`analysis`, `reanalysis`)  
- `test_type` (e.g., tensile, hardness)  
- `test_date` (if available)  
- `lab_test` (e.g., UTS, YS, Elongation)  
- `test_value` (numeric)  
- `test_session_status` (`pass`, `fail`, `deviated`)

**Inputs (sources)**  
- lab sessions table  
- lab test values table  
- foreign key resolution to `heat_num`

**Typical questions it answers**
- What are mechanical property distributions by alloy / temper / product form?
- Which heats fail acceptance criteria?
- How stable are mechanical properties over time (SPC)?
- How do analysis vs reanalysis results compare?

**Example queries**
```sql
-- Main analysis session for SPC
select
  vha.alloy_code,
  vlv.heat_num,
  vlv.lab_test,
  vlv.test_value
from v_lab_values_by_heats vlv
join v_heats_by_alloy vha
  on vha.heat_num = vlv.heat_num
where vlv.test_type = 'tensile'
  and vlv.lab_test = 'UTS'
  and vlv.session_type = 'analysis'
order by vlv.heat_num;

-- Compare analysis vs reanalysis
select
  heat_num,
  lab_test,
  max(test_value) filter (where session_type = 'analysis')   as analysis_test_value,
  max(test_value) filter (where session_type = 'reanalysis') as reanalysis_test_value
from v_lab_values_by_heats
where heat_num = 123456
group by heat_num, lab_test
order by lab_test;
```

### 4) Heats by Final Product

**Purpose**  
Provide final product characterization at the heat level: base temper, strain level, and product form (e.g., coil, sheet, disc).

**Grain**  
- 1 row per heat

**Primary key / join key**  
- `heat_num`

**Core columns (typical)**  
- `heat_num`  
- `base_temper`  
- `strain_level`  
- `product_form`  
- `thickness`  
- `width`

**Inputs (sources)**  
- temper reference tables  
- product form reference tables

**Typical questions it answers**
- How do lab results distribute by product form?
- Does chemistry drift by temper or strain level?
- How do lab tests behave for specific product segments (SPC)?

**Example query**
```sql
select
  product_form,
  base_temper,
  strain_level,
  count(*) as heats_count
from v_heats_by_final_product
group by product_form, base_temper, strain_level
order by heats_count desc;
```

**Business segmentation**  
This view is a key segmentation layer for reporting and SPC. When joined with customer mapping, it enables customer- and product-specific monitoring (e.g., O-temper discs for Customer X).

### 5) Heats by Customer

**Purpose**  
Map each heat to its customer to enable customer-segmented reporting, SPC, and traceability analysis.

**Grain**  
- 1 row per heat

**Primary key / join key**  
- `heat_num`

**Core columns (typical)**  
- `heat_num`  
- `customer`  
- `market`  
- `customer_segment`

**Inputs (sources)**  
- production orders  
- customer assignment logic at heat level

**Typical questions it answers**
- How do properties behave for a specific customer and product segment?
- How consistent is delivery to a given customer?
- How does the same product differ across customers?

**Example query**
```sql
-- Segment lab results by customer
select
  hc.customer,
  vlv.lab_test,
  avg(vlv.test_value) as avg_test_value,
  count(*) as n
from v_lab_values_by_heats vlv
join v_heats_by_customer hc
  on hc.heat_num = vlv.heat_num
where vlv.test_type = 'tensile'
group by hc.customer, vlv.lab_test
order by hc.customer, vlv.lab_test;
```

## How These Views Are Used

A typical analytical workflow assembles analysis-ready datasets by joining views:

- Chemistry + Alloy → composition monitoring and SPC  
- Lab + Final Product → mechanical property tracking  
- Chemistry + Lab + Final Product → correlation and root-cause analysis  

**Example dataset build**
```sql
select
  vha.alloy_code,
  vhfp.base_temper,
  vhfp.strain_level,
  vhfp.product_form,
  vlv.lab_test,
  vlv.test_value  as lab_test_value,
  vch.element_symbol,
  vch.element_value as chem_element_value
from v_heats_by_alloy vha
join v_heats_by_final_product vhfp
  on vha.heat_num = vhfp.heat_num
join v_lab_values_by_heats vlv
  on vlv.heat_num = vha.heat_num
join v_chem_by_heats vch
  on vch.heat_num = vha.heat_num;
```

## Customer & Product Segmentation Examples

By joining **Heats by Final Product** with **Heats by Customer**, it becomes straightforward to analyze how chemistry and mechanical properties behave by customer and product segment, and to compare delivery consistency across customers.

```sql
-- Mechanical behavior for Customer X, O-temper discs
select
  hc.customer,
  vhfp.product_form,
  vhfp.base_temper,
  vlv.lab_test,
  avg(vlv.test_value) as avg_test_value,
  count(*) as n
from v_lab_values_by_heats vlv
join v_heats_by_final_product vhfp
  on vhfp.heat_num = vlv.heat_num
join v_heats_by_customer hc
  on hc.heat_num = vlv.heat_num
where hc.customer = 'Customer X'
  and vhfp.product_form = 'disc'
  and vhfp.base_temper = 'O'
  and vhfp.thickness between 0.80 and 1.20
group by hc.customer, vhfp.product_form, vhfp.base_temper, vlv.lab_test
order by vlv.lab_test;
```
